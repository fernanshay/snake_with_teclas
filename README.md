# snake_with_teclas
Wanna play snake game? you should see this.

<strong>What's this</strong>
It's code, ok being serious with you, it's like a game, 
when you press up, down, right and left key on your computer you'll see a line moving, that's it.

<strong>How I did it</strong>

1. Firstly I created two files (.html and .js) to make the work more <strong>comfortable</strong> and funny, ok

2. You'll create a space to draw "teclas lines" with <strong>Canvas</strong>, to make the magic work you have to create a <strong><script> tag</strong>, and after that you put an <strong>"AddEventListener"</strong> in this case <strong>keydown</strong>

3. The way AddEventListener works is with <strong>functions</strong>. Step 3 create that function, with that I create "teclas" variable including all the key Code i'll need (Arrow up, Arrow down, ...)

4. This is rare <strong>Switch</strong>, it's a Conditional, well i create that with <strong>( event.keyCode )</strong> from <strong>AddEventListener function</strong>.

5. <strong>Decorate everything.</strong>
